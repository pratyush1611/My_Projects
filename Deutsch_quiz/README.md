# Deutsch_quiz
this repo is being developed for purpose of creation of a german quiz to remember the vocabulary better


Initially the code uses pandas and a self inputted wortschatz of A1 level german to form a quiz

presentation needs to be improved

## future plans:
-> include option for selection of chapter to test from or a combination of then

-> other option of having an artikel quiz

-> a quiz option for trennbar verbs too

-> or verbs only or nouns only

-> or a reverse quiz for given word in english find german word

-> another future plan is to mix it along with kivy and form an android app of the same

### this would be the final plan
