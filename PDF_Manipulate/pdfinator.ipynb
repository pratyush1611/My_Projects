    "# ABOUT\n",
    "This notebook is meant for translating normal A4 PDF to A3 booklets optimised for printing at TU Delft\n",
    "1. saves money\n",
    "2. saves paper\n",
    "3. saves electricity, by printing half the number of pages\n",
    "4. dont have to deal with annoying flips in single stapled documents\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methodology\n",
    "1. Make booklet\n",
    "    1. first arrange the PDF and insert the blank pages at the right places: the code hence formed returns a PDF with single pages in the reverse order\n",
    "    2. after single page booklet-order formation the booklet needs to be formed in A3\n",
    "2. Rotate pages\n",
    "    * once the A3 booklet like Adobe booklet is formed, we rotate every even numbered page by 90 degrees and odd ones by -90 degrees so as to make it printable in A3 at TU Delft printers, since the printers only print along the short edge of A3"
